/*

Given a m x n maze with some blocked cells (marked with 'X'), and rat that wants to
go from the src (0, 0) to the dst (m-1, n-1) design a recursive algorithm to
	
	> check if there exists a path from src to dst

such at each step the rat can only move in the right or down direction.

Constraint 

 1 <= m, n < 10

Example 
	Input : 

		maze = {"0000",
	            "00X0",
	            "000X",
	            "0X00"}
	
	Output :

		true (Yes, a path exist from src to dst)
